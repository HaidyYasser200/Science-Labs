The lesson explains the concept of adaptation in living organisms and how it helps them survive in different environments.It clarifies 
that adaptation can be:
                    • Structural (changes in the body)
                    • Behavioral (changes in actions)
                    • Physiological (internal body processes)
The lesson provides examples from deserts, forests, cold regions, and aquatic environments, showing how each adaptation supports 
the organism’s survival and ability to live successfully in its habitat.

homework:

1. Explain the concept of adaptation in living organisms and give one example.


2. Compare structural adaptation and behavioral adaptation in meaning and example.


3. Describe how adaptations help organisms survive in different environments.


4. Choose an organism and identify three adaptations that help it live in its habitat.


5. In your opinion, why is adaptation important for protecting living organisms from dangers?


6. Explain why desert plants have spines instead of broad leaves.


7. Analyze how adaptations in cold environments differ from those in the desert environment.
